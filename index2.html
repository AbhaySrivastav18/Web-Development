    <h2>Iron Man</h2>
    <p>
      Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
      scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby,
      the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 and received
      his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron
      Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, with
      Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and
      with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's
      creation. Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony"
      Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing
      company Stark Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and
      sustained a severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and escaped
      his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman strength,
      flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was created
      in response to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to create a likeable
      pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been used to explore
      political themes, with early Iron Man stories being set in the Cold War.
      The character's role as a weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and
      Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s.

    <h2>Publication history</h2>
    <p>
      Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent
      revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, Marvel Comics
      created new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the initial concept
      for Iron Man.[1] He wanted to design a character who should be unpalatable
      to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the character
      anyway.[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms
      industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into
      the character's backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an active
      player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam
      during Iron Man's creation as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that
      the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good
      versus evil".[4] Larry Lieber developed Iron Man's origin and wrote the
      first Iron Man story, while Jack Kirby and Don Heck were responsible for
      the initial design.[1][5] Lee modeled Iron Man after businessman Howard
      Hughes, invoking his physical appearance, his image as a businessman, and
      his reputation as an arrogant playboy.[6] Kirby and Heck then incorporated
      elements of the actor Errol Flynn's physical appearance in the design.[7]
      When first designing the character, Lee wanted to create a modernized
      Arthurian knight.[8] Kirby initially drew the Iron Man armor as a "round
      and clunky gray heap", and Heck modified the design to incorporate gadgets
      such as jets, drills, and suction cups.[9][10] The Iron Man character was
      created at a time when comic book characters were first depicted
      struggling with real-life problems, and his heart injury was an early
      example of a superhero with a physical disability.

    <h2>Characterization</h2>
    <p>
      Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born in Long Island, New York. As a child,
      he inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, when his parents
      were killed in a car crash.[83] Developing equipment for the U.S.
      military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he
      triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he
      is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a
      weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart,
      becoming Iron Man.[18][9] The war zone Stark visited was changed
      retroactively multiple times by different writers to correspond with the
      character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in
      which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change.
      This conflict was the Vietnam War for the first decades of Iron Man's
      publication history.[84] This was changed to an unnamed Southeast Asian
      country in the 1990s,[85] and a conflict in the fictional country Siancong
      was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.
